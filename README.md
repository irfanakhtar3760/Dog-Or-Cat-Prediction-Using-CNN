# Dog-Or-Cat-Prediction-Using-CNN
A dog or cat prediction model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) would involve training a neural network on a dataset of images of dogs and cats to learn the features and patterns that distinguish them. This model can then be used to classify new images as either a dog or a cat with high accuracy.
